# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts rainfall using historical weather data.  
It is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`Rainfall_Prediction.ipynb`) with data preprocessing, machine learning model training, and evaluation.

## 📊 Project Overview
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on weather dataset  
- Data preprocessing: handling missing values, scaling, and encoding  
- Model building using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Model evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report  
- Visualizations of results
